Pre-release (minor version bumps)

* Verify each manpage is thorough and consistent with the program it describes.
** entwatch.1
** entmesh.8
** Verify that all manpages are represented in this sublist.

* Verify AUTHORS file is up-to-date

* Verify programs install to their intended destinations
** entwatch should land in bin
** entbuff should land in sbin
** Verify that all programs are represented in this sublist.

* Review README to ensure each section is correct.
** Correct any outdated information, elaborate or add on to questions and FAQ
pieces. Add external references.
** Spellcheck
** Verify external hyperlinks are still valid.

* Test programs
** entwatch
*** Verify "-w" behaves as described.
*** Verify "-r" works as described. (Find some way to make /dev/random
inaccessible to program, and set up second device node to work on)
*** Verify "-h" output is correct:
**** Presents program usage
**** Lists every parameter, along with each parameter's usage and meaning.
*** Verify santity checks for each command-line parameter:
**** -r file must exist and be readable.
**** -w must be an integer greater than 0.
**** Verify this sublist is complete and correct.
*** Verify this sublist is complete and correct.
** entbuff
*** Verify "-i" and "-l" behave as described.
*** Verify "-w" and "-p" behave as described.
*** Verify "-r" works as described. (Find some way to make /dev/random
inaccessible to program, and set up second device node to work on)
*** Verify -R logs read-from-rand trace points, and only read-from-rand trace
points.
*** Verify -W logs write-to-rand trace points, and only write-to-rand trace
points.
*** Verify -b controls the buffer size as described.
*** Verify -h output is correct:
**** Presents program usage
**** Lists every parameter, along with each parameter's usage and meaning.
*** Verify sanity checks for each command-line parameter:
**** Verify that -i and -l only accept integer multiples of 8 greater than 0.
**** Verify that -w and -p only accept integers greater than 0.
**** Verify that -r must exist, be readable, and must allow data to be added to the
entropy pool.
**** Verify that -b must be an integer greater than 0.
**** Verify that this sublist is correct.
*** Verify that this sublist is correct.

* Repeat this list until no changes are necessary; responding to one item may
have invalidated another.

Pre-release (major version bumps)
* Check that programs behave consistently with one another. Familiarity with
behavior in one program or option must translate to familiarity with analogous
behavior in another program where present, or must be clearly noted in the
manpage.
* Also, pre-release (minor version bumps)
* Repeat this list until no changes are necessary; responding to one item may
have invalidated another.

Pre-commit reminders:
* Check that the program still builds.
* Check that the code can be tested. Write the test(s)

Pre-merge reminders:
* Check that the programs pass your tests.
